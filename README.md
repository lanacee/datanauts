## Fruit fly can have a devastating impact on local horticulture industries:

- Fruit fly outbreaks in areas that are normally free of these pests can cause hundreds of millions of dollars a year in lost income and eradication costs.
- Controlling fruit flies can be a major expense for large scale commercial producers, leading to higher prices for consumers.
- Infested fruit is not suitable for sale, therefore reducing orchard productivity. In severe cases, entire crops can be made worthless.
- The imposition of interstate and international quarantine conditions either limits market access opportunities or makes it more expensive.
